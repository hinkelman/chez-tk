# chez-tk
A Chez Scheme Interface to the Tk GUI Toolkit

Modification of [`(rebottled pstk)`](https://akkuscm.org/packages/(rebottled%20pstk)/) to work with Chez Scheme. `chez-tk` will be submitted to Akku after adding examples and documentation. However, the [documentation](http://snow-fort.org/s/peterlane.info/peter/rebottled/pstk/1.7.0/index.html) for `(rebottled pstk)` should be accurate for `chez-tk`, too.
